Notes on Acceleration and Motion

Calculation
1. If acceleration is track-invariant (constant within a track),
		 A = A(T), constant throttle (T)
   Corollary:
	   Deceleration is constant.
   V1(t) = V0 + At, constant throttle over period t
   X1(t) = 1/2*A*t^2 + V0*t + X0, constant throttle over t

1/2*A*t^2 + V0*t - X = 0

Measurement
1. Under constant velocity, 
     V(X, t) = X / t
2. Under constant acceleration, 
     A(X, V0, t) = 2X/(t^2) - 2V0/t
